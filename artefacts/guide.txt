This is a small guide to the header files, while the cpp files are 1 to 1 corresponding

Main header: metadiff.h - just includes everything in correct order
#include "symbolic_integers.h" - include the symbolic_integers module
#include "utils.h" - contains utility function for operating with OS as well as single logging point for the project
#include "enums.h" - contains all enums and constant definitions
#include "props.h" - a header dedicate to Properties of the framework. Similar to Theano this should read a file
                     and environmental variables and populate the properties accordingly at the start of execution
#include "definitions.h" - contains definition of any classes except the main ones
#include "helpers.h" - contains definition of any helper functions
#include "node.h" - defines the Node API interface and the NodeData
#include "shared.h" - defines the SharedVariable API interface
#include "graph.h" - defines the Graph API interface and GraphData
#include "print.h" - defines functions for printing different classes
#include "exceptions.h" - defines different exceptions used
#include "operators/operators.h" - imports all of the operators
